## Variables 

- Variables are words that store data

- You can think of variables as boxes that have a label
    - The label is the name of the variables, and inside the box we store the various kinds of data

- We can use the print keyword to print out the data stored in our variables to the screen

```python
>>> name = "Gabe"
>>> print(name)
```
- The print command is not only for variables. It will print out any data type you give it

- You can change variables and manipulate them

```python
>>> year = 2022
>>> print(year)
>>> new_year = year + 1
>>> print(new_year)
>>> name = "Gabe"
>>> print("Hello "+name)
```

## Saving Python Files

- Now that we have talked about the basic command you need to know to get started with Python, letâ€™s start making some 	real programs instead of typing all these commands into the IDLE

- A computer program is simply a collection of commands that are executed one after the other

- Some computer programs only have one command in them, while others could be could contain millions of commands

- We can save programs so that we can use them for later 

- Letâ€™s create a Python file (make sure to include the .py suffix)

- Once the program is created, letâ€™s make our very first Python program

<br>

> hello_world.py
```python
message = "Hello world!"
print(message)
```

- Save the program, and run it using the default Python editor

- Congrats, you just wrote your first Python program ðŸŽ‰
    - From now, until the end of time, that program will do that exact same thing when you run it

- Get used to this notion of making and saving files, we will be doing it A LOT

## Getting Input

- Pythyon makes it easy to get input from the terminal
- Simply use the `input` keyword

> get_input.py
```python
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, "+user_input+"!")
```

## Comments

- Comments are used to explain code
- Comments are denoted by a `#` in Python 
- When the code is run, comments are completely ignored

```python
# This is an example of a comment
# These two lines will be completely ignored
```

## If Statements

- Letâ€™s move onto some more complex concepts in Python, starting with the if statement

- Takes in a comparison and runs different blocks of code based on the comparison. If statements are an incredibly powerful tool 	because the allow computers to "think" a little more like humans

> if_statement.py
```python
if 1 < 2:
	print("One is less than two")

if 1 > 2:
	print("One is greater than two")

if 1 > 2:
	print("One is greater than two")
else:
	print("One is not greater than two")

password = "1234"
input = "134"

if password == input:
	print("Login successful")
else:
	print("Incorrect password, try again")
```

## For Loops

- For loops repeat a block of code n times

- We will go into more depth concerning lists later, for now, just think of them as a collection of items

> for_loop.py
```python
for i in range(10):
	print("Yo dog")

counter = 0
for i in range(100):
	print(str(counter)+"bottles of beer on the wall")
	counter = counter + 1

for i in range(5):
	print(str(i)+"bottles of beer on the wall")
```

## While Loops

- While loops repeat until a condition is met

> while_loop.py
```python
user_input = input("Say uncle: ")

while (user_input != "uncle"):
    user_input = input("Say uncle: ")
```
